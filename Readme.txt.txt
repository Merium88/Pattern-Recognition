Execute the Main file 'EE5907_Main' to execute all Questions 1-4 and plot their results
The following is done in the main file:
  a) Call preprocessing function from file 'preprocess.m'
  b) Call Beta-Bernoulli Naive Bayes function from file 'BB_Naive.m'
  c) Plot error curves and sensitivity and specificty plots for Beta-Bernoulli
  d) Call Gaussian function from file 'Gaussian_Naive.m'
  e) Call Logistic regression function from file 'logistic_regression.m'
  f) Plot error curves and sensitivity and specificty plots for Logistic Regression
  g) Call K-Nearest neighbor function from file 'KNN.m' 
  h) Plot error curves and sensitivity and specificty plots for KNN

Additional File: 
'error_est' computes the error rate for predicted and original ydata

NOTE: If exectution of 1 function is required, please comment all subsequent questions to decrease running time.
